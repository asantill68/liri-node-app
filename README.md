Are you not entertained?
Finding information on your entertainement may be a headache!  With all the reasources at your finguretips it may be hard to pick the right website to access the information quickly.  For this reason we came up with the answer to find this information with a few key words and values. 

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI is simple to use.  Siply go to your command line on your device and punch in a few words and watch your options appear before your very eyes.

Simply use the following COMMAND:  movie-this; concert-this; spotify-this.
Followed by a VALUE:  Unforgiven, Def Leppard, Thriller.
The combination of the COMMAND and VALUE (i.e. "movie-this Unforgiven") will provide you with inforamation on the query you have requested.  It's that simple!  Below are two links to illustrate what enter and to expect from using liri.
